# Surfs_up

## Overview
W. Avy, an investor who is famous for his surfing passion, is willing to invest on a surf and ice cream shop business in Oahu. Thus, the aim of this project consists in performing some analytics on weather data in order to find out whether this opportunity is a year-round type of business or seasonal only.  
In other words, this analysis will be focus on finding temperature trends for the months of June and December to determine if this type of business will be sustainable year-round.  
As a result, we will need to provide two technical analyses as follows:
-	An analysis that shows the statistical summary of temperature during June
-	An analysis that shows the statistical summary of temperature during December

## Results
After the whole analysis was executed, we found the following summary statistics for both the month of June and the month of December, respectively. 

### Summary Statistics for June Temperatures

### Summary Statistics for December Temperatures

### Key Differences 
As the images show, there are three important differences between the temperature recorded during June and the temperature recorded during December. 
-	The number of observations during June is 1,700.00, while in December there is only 1,517.00.
However, the standard deviation (std) in December is higher than the one in June. 
-	The first quartile of summary statistics for December shows a temperature of 69 while the one for June shows a temperature of 73, while the 3rd quartile for December shows a temperature of 74 while the one for June has 77.
-	The minimum temperature recorded in December is 59 F, while the minimum temperature recorded during June is 64. Likewise, the first and second results detailed above, this corroborates and confirms why the std of December is higher that the std for June again. 

## Summary
Finally, it is clear than December turns to be just a little colder than June, but nothing really different. It shows that the average temperature in Oahu during the entire year is steady, so it is around 71-75 degrees. 

### Recommendations
Other queries that should be important to run in order to get more data would be the following:
-	Summary Statistics for June Precipitation
-	Summary Statistics for December Precipitation 
-	In addition to that, it may also be helpful to run similar queries for different months too.
